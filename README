Date_column
===========

Examples
========

# this will create a start_date_value virtual attribute for use with a text
# field in your forms.
date_column :start_date

# we usually want an end date entered by the user to be part of the time span.
# So it's a good idea to store the beginning of the *next* day internally. This
# is transparently handled by the :offset option.
# :default is eval'd if present to initialize the text field when displaying a
# record with an empty end_date field.
date_column :end_date, :offset => 1.day, :default => '1.month.from_now'

Todo
====
support for other date formats than 'dd.mm.yyyy'
